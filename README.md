# House_price_prediction
## Introduction
Purchasing a home is a difficult decision, especially in a city like Bengaluru. There are additional considerations to take into account for India's Silicon Valley, even if the main ones are often the same for all metro areas. Bengaluru's millennial population, dynamic culture, wonderful environment, and abundance of employment prospects make it challenging to estimate the cost of a home there.
## Aim of the project
Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc.
## Steps
1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Dealing with a missing values or noisy data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Create new features from existing features
5. Remove outliers
6. Data visualisation
7. Splitting data into the training and testing 
8. Train linear regression model and test.
9. Scaling of features
10.Train Support vector regression and test.
## Method used
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Regression
## Result
1. Using Multiple linear regression algorithm and I got R-square of 0.84 over the testing data.
2. Using Support Vector regression algorithm and I got R-square of 0.77 over the testing data.
